# Conditional tests to Make Decisions
---
## To-Do:
* Use IF statements for conditional tests.
* Compare two values: <, >, ==.
* Use else as opposite of IF.
* Chain Conditional tests together.
* Use SWITCH-CASE for complicated conditional tests.
* Create tests with the ternary operator.

## IF-statement example
```
long account = 18000;

if (account > 0){

    System.out.prinln("Account is larger than 0");
    
    }

```
