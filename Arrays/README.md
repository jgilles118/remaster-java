## The Tricks of Arrays
---

Arrays can be a little tricky at first. Keep in mind some of these facts\
to interate through an array list:
> The .length() method is to retrieve a character count of a single string[].\
> The .length property is to retrieve the item count of a list string[].

*A space character will also be included as a character in the **.length()** method.*
```
String car = "Aston Martin";

System.out.println(car.length());

//Will display: 12
```

**.length** will count the amount of items in a list. 
```
String[] cars = {"Ford","GMC","Chevy","Dodge"};

System.out.println(cars.length);

//Will display: 4
```
